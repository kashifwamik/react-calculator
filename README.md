# Calculator App

This is a basic calculator application built using **React** with **Vite** as the build tool. It provides essential arithmetic operations in a clean, responsive UI. The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and resetting inputs, and handles edge cases like invalid operations.

## Features

- Real-time display updates as buttons are clicked.
- Error handling for invalid expressions.
- Responsive design with custom styling.

## Usage

- Use the numeric buttons (0-9) and operator buttons (+, -, \*, /) to enter a mathematical expression.
- Click **AC** to clear the current input.
- Press **=** to evaluate the expression and display the result.
- The calculator prevents invalid operations and offers basic error handling.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Front-end library for building the UI.
- **Vite**: Fast build tool for a modern development workflow.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and layout.
- **CSS**: Custom styling for additional design flexibility.

## Responsive Design

The calculator app is fully responsive and adjusts its layout based on the screen size. The layout has been optimized using media queries to ensure it looks great on both mobile and desktop screens.

- **Mobile Devices**: The app adjusts to smaller screen widths, ensuring the calculator buttons and display are easy to interact with.
- **Tablets and Desktops**: The layout scales appropriately, maintaining readability and ease of use.
